# Signal and System Dr. Ghasemian plots with Jupyter

![banner of project](assets/banner.png)

This project contains Jupyter notebooks for plotting various signals commonly used in signal processing and universities courses.

## Usage ⚙️

- Each Jupyter notebook in this project corresponds to a specific type of signal. You can open and run these notebooks to generate plots for different signals.
- I wrote my codes in [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so I recommend you to open Jupyter files with it too.
- I did not wrote plt.show(), so you can add it in last line of all Jupyter files if needed!
- Please before run Jupyter codes, with pip install numpy and matplotlib in your terminal:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
